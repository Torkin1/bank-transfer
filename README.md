This app is intended to incrementally showcase applications of patterns commonly used in Software Engineering and teached in the ISPW course at the University of Rome "Tor Vergata".

The repository history is flagged with tags, with each tag underlining a specific configuration of patterns used in the development. You are encouraged to navigate the tags and repository commits history to search for the application of specific patterns (i.e: bce, mvc, GoF patterns, ...)

If you have any question you can raise them in class if you are attending the 2024/2025 edition of the course, or you can contact me at my [mail](mailto:daniele.laprova@hotmail.it)
